## `02` Initialize Pipenv

## 📝Instructions

Run the following command to create a new virtual environment with python 3 on it:

```bash
$ pipenv --three
```

You should see a **PipFile** on the root of your project and it should have inside a **[requires]** for python version 3+ similar this one (but maybe with a different python 3 version)
