## `03` First Flask App

Flask is a app that behaves like a web server, that means that it exposes (publishes) a group of URLs to the internet.

To create our first server we need to add the folloing two lines to any python file:

```python
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)
```

## 📝Instructions

1. On the root of your project create a `src` folder.  
2. Inside of it create a file `src/app.py` and add the code to create a new flask app that was specified above the instructions.
